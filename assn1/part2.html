      Welcome to our fake birdwatching site. If this was a real site, it would have be 
      ideal place to come and learn more about birdwatching, whether you are a 
      beginner looking to learn how to get into birding, or an expert wanting to share
      ideas, tips, and photos with other like-minded people.

      So don't waste! Get what you need, turn off that computer and get out 
      into the great outdoors!
