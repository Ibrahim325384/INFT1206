      <h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
        
        Dear Eileen, <br>
        
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part <br>
        of your <u>PhD</u> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
        
        <h3>Starting dates</h3>
        
        We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
        
        <ul>
          <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
          <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
          <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        
        Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. <br>
        <br>
        
        You can find more information about <a href = "https://durhamcollege.ca/info-for/current-students/important-dates">important university dates</a> on our website.
        
        
        <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
        
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
        by are as follows, in order of priority:
        
        <ol type = "1">
          <li>H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
          <li>
            Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br>
            audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)
          </li>
          <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        
        
        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        
        <dl>
          <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
               <dd>
                 A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around <br>
                 in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
               </dd>
          <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
               <dd>
                 Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
                 involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
                 tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
                 modern styles such as Twerking.
               </dd>
          <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
               <dd>
                 An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
                 discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
                 of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
                 because they were really cold.
               </dd>
        </dl>

        <br>
        Yours sincerely, <br>
        <br>
